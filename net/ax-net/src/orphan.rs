//! Orphan socket management for TCP connections.
//!
//! When a user closes a TCP socket, the userspace object is dropped immediately,
//! but the underlying smoltcp socket may still need to finish FIN exchange or
//! TIME-WAIT. This module keeps those sockets in a small orphan pool so the
//! dedicated net-poll worker can continue protocol teardown after the file
//! descriptor is gone.
//!
//! # Lifecycle
//!
//! - `TcpSocket::drop()` unregisters public bind/listen state and moves the
//!   smoltcp handle into the orphan pool.
//! - `reap_orphans()` runs from the poll path while `SocketSet` is already
//!   locked.
//! - Closed sockets are removed immediately; TIME-WAIT and FIN states are kept
//!   until smoltcp finishes or the maximum linger time expires.
//!
//! # Overflow Policy
//!
//! The pool has a hard capacity guard, but it does not blindly kill active
//! TIME-WAIT/FIN sockets just because the pool is full. Closed or expired
//! entries are reaped first; still-tearing-down entries are preserved so normal
//! TCP semantics win over aggressive cleanup.
