//! Per-task hardware-PMU `perf` counting (`perf stat -- cmd`).
//!
//! Where [`super::hw`] in `pid <= 0` mode counts on the *current* CPU
//! system-wide (M0–M2), this module counts a *specific task*: the counter is
//! programmed onto hardware only while the target task is the running task, and
//! its per-slice deltas are accumulated across context switches. That is what
//! makes `perf stat -- /bin/true` attribute events to the workload rather than
//! to whatever happened to run on the CPU.
//!
//! ## Ownership and lifetime
//!
//! A [`PerTaskCounter`] is shared (`Arc`) between two places:
//!
//! * the target [`Thread`]'s `perf_counters` list, walked by the scheduler
//!   hooks ([`perf_sched_in`] / [`perf_sched_out`]) and the exec/exit hooks, and
//! * the [`super::hw::HwPerfEvent`] behind the perf fd, which serves
//!   `read(perf_fd)` / `ioctl(ENABLE/DISABLE/RESET)` and frees the HW counter on
//!   `Drop`.
//!
//! Both can outlive the other (the fd can be `close`d while the task runs, or
//! the task can exit while the fd is still open), so the HW counter is freed via
//! the idempotent [`free_hw`] from whichever side reaches end-of-life first
//! ([`HwPerfEvent::drop`] or [`on_task_exit`]).
//!
//! ## Hot-path cost
//!
//! The scheduler hooks run inside `switch_to` with IRQs disabled and preemption
//! off: no allocation, no sleeping locks. They early-return on a single relaxed
//! load of [`PERF_TASK_ACTIVE`] when no per-task counter exists anywhere, so the
//! common (perf-unused) case is one atomic load per switch.
//!
//! ## Per-task sampling (`perf record -- cmd`, M3-pt-rec)
//!
//! A per-task event opened with `pid > 0` AND `sample_period > 0` (and
//! `sample_type == PERF_SAMPLE_IP`) behaves like an [M2 sampling
//! event](super::sampling) *while the attached task is running*, and fires no
//! samples while it is not — so the samples are attributed to the task.
//!
//! This reuses the M2 IRQ backend wholesale. The mechanism is:
//!
//! * `mmap(perf_fd)` allocates the ring (in [`super::hw::HwPerfEvent::device_mmap`])
//!   and stashes the ring vaddr/len + the page/notify anchors onto the shared
//!   [`PerTaskCounter`] via [`PerTaskCounter::set_ring`].
//! * [`perf_sched_in`] arms the slice: `preload` the counter to overflow after
//!   `sample_period` events, `register` a [`SampleSlot`](super::sampling::SampleSlot)
//!   pointing at the ptc's ring + notify, and `enable_irq` the overflow line.
//! * [`perf_sched_out`] disarms the slice: stop the counter, `disable_irq`, and
//!   `unregister` the slot — so the next time some *other* task runs, an overflow
//!   on this counter cannot fire a sample into our ring.
//!
//! The IRQ-half (the overflow handler writing `PERF_RECORD_SAMPLE` and re-arming)
//! is exactly the M2 [`super::sampling::pmu_overflow_handler`] — nothing here
//! runs in IRQ context except via the registered slot.
//!
//! ## Scope / deferrals
//!
//! Single-core M2 scope: no counter multiplexing (so `time_running ==
//! time_enabled`), no cross-core migration. Sampling supports both fixed-period
//! (`-c <period>`) and frequency mode (`-F`, `sample_freq`); in frequency mode
//! the overflow handler adapts the period per slice toward the target rate.
//! `attr.inherit` (following `fork`/`clone` children) is deferred: the counter
//! follows the single attached task only.
