//! PMU overflow-IRQ sampling backend (`perf record`).
//!
//! This is the IRQ half of hardware-PMU sampling. A sampling perf event
//! ([`super::hw::HwPerfEvent`] with `sample_period > 0`) preloads a programmable
//! counter so it overflows after `period` events; the overflow raises the PMUv3
//! interrupt (PPI 7 / INTID 23). [`pmu_overflow_handler`] runs in hard-IRQ
//! context, reads the interrupted PC, builds one `PERF_RECORD_SAMPLE` per
//! overflowed counter, writes it into that event's mmap ring buffer, re-arms the
//! counter, and wakes a deferred worker (via [`ax_task::IrqNotify`]) that
//! delivers `POLLIN` to userspace pollers.
//!
//! The record emitted honours the event's `attr.sample_type`: [`build_sample`]
//! lays out every requested scalar field in the canonical `man perf_event_open`
//! order, so the real `perf` tool — which always sets `IP|TID|TIME|PERIOD` —
//! parses the stream and reports samples. The supported field set is
//! [`SUPPORTED_SAMPLE_TYPE`]; an unsupported bit is rejected at open in
//! [`super::hw`]. A `sample_type` of exactly `PERF_SAMPLE_IP` still yields the
//! original 16-byte IP-only record.
//!
//! IRQ-context discipline (enforced throughout this module's handler path):
//! no allocation, no sleeping locks, and the interrupted `ELR_EL1` / `SPSR_EL1`
//! are read *first* (before touching the PMU or memory) so a nested fault can
//! never clobber them.
//!
//! # Per-CPU registry
//!
//! The handler must locate the ring buffer for an overflowed counter `n` without
//! allocating or taking a lock. [`REGISTRY`] is a fixed `[Option<SampleSlot>; 32]`
//! per CPU (index = programmable counter index). A [`SampleSlot`] is a small
//! `Copy` POD carrying exactly the raw values the handler needs. `register` /
//! `unregister` mutate the *current* CPU's array under a local-IRQ-off critical
//! section ([`NoPreemptIrqSave`]) so they never race the handler. M2 is
//! single-core, so the event's core is always cpu0.
//!
//! # `notify` raw pointer soundness
//!
//! `SampleSlot::notify` is a raw `*const IrqNotify`. It is valid for the whole
//! time the slot is registered because the owning event holds a strong
//! `Arc<IrqNotify>` for its entire life, and teardown
//! ([`super::hw::HwPerfEvent`]'s disable/Drop) calls [`unregister`] — clearing
//! the slot — *before* dropping that `Arc`. The handler therefore only ever
//! dereferences a pointer whose target is still alive.
