//! Memory allocation and address translation APIs for the AxVisor hypervisor.
//!
//! This module provides APIs for physical memory management, including frame
//! allocation/deallocation and physical-virtual address translation.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The memory APIs are fundamental to the hypervisor's operation, enabling:
//! - Physical frame allocation for guest memory
//! - Contiguous frame allocation for DMA and other hardware requirements
//! - Address translation between physical and virtual addresses
//!
//! # Re-exports
//!
//! This module re-exports [`PhysAddr`] and [`VirtAddr`] from the `ax_memory_addr`
//! crate for convenience.
//!
//! # Types
//!
//! - [`PhysFrame`] - A physical frame that is automatically deallocated when
//!   dropped.
//!
//! # Implementation
//!
//! To implement these APIs, use the [`api_impl`](crate::api_impl) attribute
//! macro on an impl block:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! struct MemoryIfImpl;
//!
//! #[axvisor_api::api_impl]
//! impl axvisor_api::memory::MemoryIf for MemoryIfImpl {
//!     fn alloc_frame() -> Option<PhysAddr> {
//!         // Allocate a physical frame from your allocator
//!     }
//!     // ... implement other functions
//! }
//! ```

///
/// This trait defines the core memory management interface required by the
/// hypervisor. Implementations should be provided by the host system or HAL
/// layer.
