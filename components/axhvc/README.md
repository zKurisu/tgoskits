AxVisor HyperCall definitions for guest-hypervisor communication.

## Overview

This crate provides the hypercall interface for [AxVisor](https://github.com/arceos-hypervisor/axvisor), a type-1 hypervisor based on [ArceOS](https://github.com/arceos-org/arceos). It defines the hypercall codes and result types used for communication between guest VMs and the hypervisor.

## Features

- `no_std` compatible - suitable for bare-metal and embedded environments
- Defines all supported hypercall operations
- Provides type-safe hypercall codes with numeric enum conversion
- Cross-platform support (x86_64, RISC-V, AArch64)

## Supported Hypercalls

| Code | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 0 | `HypervisorDisable` | Disable the hypervisor |
| 1 | `HyperVisorPrepareDisable` | Prepare to disable the hypervisor |
| 2 | `HyperVisorDebug` | Debug hypercall (development only) |
| 3 | `HIVCPublishChannel` | Publish an IVC shared memory channel |
| 4 | `HIVCSubscribChannel` | Subscribe to an IVC shared memory channel |
| 5 | `HIVCUnPublishChannel` | Unpublish an IVC shared memory channel |
| 6 | `HIVCUnSubscribChannel` | Unsubscribe from an IVC shared memory channel |

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
axhvc = "0.1"
```

### Example

```rust,ignore
use axhvc::{HyperCallCode, HyperCallResult};

fn handle_hypercall(code: HyperCallCode) -> HyperCallResult {
    match code {
        HyperCallCode::HypervisorDisable => {
            // Handle hypervisor disable request
            Ok(0)
        }
        HyperCallCode::HIVCPublishChannel => {
            // Handle IVC channel publish request
            Ok(0)
        }
        _ => Err(axerrno::AxError::Unsupported),
    }
}
