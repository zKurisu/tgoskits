Spin-based synchronization primitives.

This crate provides [spin-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinlock)
versions of the primitives in `std::sync`. Because synchronization is done
through spinning, the primitives are suitable for use in `no_std` environments.

Before deciding to use `spin`, we recommend reading
[this superb blog post](https://matklad.github.io/2020/01/02/spinlocks-considered-harmful.html)
by [@matklad](https://github.com/matklad/) that discusses the pros and cons of
spinlocks. If you have access to `std`, it's likely that the primitives in
`std::sync` will serve you better except in very specific circumstances.

## Features

- `Once` and `LazyLock` equivalents
- Support for `no_std` environments
- [`lock_api`](https://crates.io/crates/lock_api) compatibility
- Guards can be sent and shared between threads
- Guard leaking
- Ticket locks
- Different strategies for dealing with contention

## Usage

Include the following under the `[dependencies]` section in your `Cargo.toml` file.

```toml
spin = "x.y"
```

## TGOSKits vendored status

This vendored copy is intentionally reduced during the TGOSKits spin migration.
`spin::Mutex`, `spin::mutex`, `spin::Barrier`, and the mutex-related feature
flags have been removed. `spin::RwLock`, `spin::rwlock`, and the `rwlock`
feature have also been removed. New lock users should choose a project-local
lock such as `ax_kspin` or `ax_sync` according to their context semantics.

## Feature flags

The crate comes with a few feature flags that you may wish to use.

- `once` enables the `Once` type.

- `lazylock` enables the `LazyLock` type.

- `lock_api` enables support for [`lock_api`](https://crates.io/crates/lock_api)

- `std` enables support for thread yielding instead of spinning.

- `portable-atomic` enables usage of the `portable-atomic` crate
  to support platforms without native atomic operations (Cortex-M0, etc.).
  The `portable_atomic_unsafe_assume_single_core` or `critical-section` feature
  of `portable-atomic` crate must also be set by the final binary crate.
  See the documentation for the `portable-atomic` crate for more information
  with some requirements for no-std build:

## Remarks

It is often desirable to have a lock shared between threads. Wrapping the lock in an
`std::sync::Arc` is route through which this might be achieved.

Locks provide zero-overhead access to their data when accessed through a mutable
reference by using their `get_mut` methods.

The behaviour of these lock is similar to their namesakes in `std::sync`. they
differ on the following:

- Locks will not be poisoned in case of failure.
- Threads will not yield to the OS scheduler when encounter a lock that cannot be
  accessed. Instead, they will 'spin' in a busy loop until the lock becomes available.

Many of the feature flags listed above are enabled by default. If you're writing a
library, we recommend disabling those that you don't use to avoid increasing compilation
time for your crate's users. You can do this like so:

```
[dependencies]
spin = { version = "x.y", default-features = false, features = [...] }
```
