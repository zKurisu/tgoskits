//! Basic traits and structures for emulated devices in ArceOS hypervisor.
//!
//! This crate provides the foundational abstractions for implementing virtual devices
//! in the [AxVisor](https://github.com/arceos-hypervisor/axvisor) hypervisor. It is
//! designed for `no_std` environments and supports multiple architectures.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The crate contains the following key components:
//!
//! - [`BaseDeviceOps`]: The core trait that all emulated devices must implement.
//! - [`EmuDeviceType`]: Enumeration representing the type of emulator devices
//!   (re-exported from `axvmconfig` crate).
//! - [`EmulatedDeviceConfig`]: Configuration structure for device initialization.
//! - Trait aliases for specific device types:
//!   - [`BaseMmioDeviceOps`]: For MMIO (Memory-Mapped I/O) devices.
//!   - [`BaseSysRegDeviceOps`]: For system register devices.
//!   - [`BasePortDeviceOps`]: For port I/O devices.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! To implement a custom emulated device, you need to implement the [`BaseDeviceOps`]
//! trait with the appropriate address range type:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use axdevice_base::{BaseDeviceOps, EmuDeviceType};
//! use axaddrspace::{GuestPhysAddrRange, device::AccessWidth};
//! use ax_errno::AxResult;
//!
//! struct MyDevice {
//!     base_addr: usize,
//!     size: usize,
//! }
//!
//! impl BaseDeviceOps<GuestPhysAddrRange> for MyDevice {
//!     fn emu_type(&self) -> EmuDeviceType {
//!         EmuDeviceType::Dummy
//!     }
//!
//!     fn address_range(&self) -> GuestPhysAddrRange {
//!         (self.base_addr..self.base_addr + self.size).try_into().unwrap()
//!     }
//!
//!     fn handle_read(&self, addr: GuestPhysAddr, width: AccessWidth) -> AxResult<usize> {
//!         // Handle read operation
//!         Ok(0)
//!     }
//!
//!     fn handle_write(&self, addr: GuestPhysAddr, width: AccessWidth, val: usize) -> AxResult {
//!         // Handle write operation
//!         Ok(())
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Feature Flags
//!
//! This crate currently has no optional feature flags. All functionality is available
//! by default.

#![no_std]
#![feature(trait_alias)]
// trait_upcasting has been stabilized in Rust 1.86, but we still need a while to update the minimum

/// # Type Parameters
///
/// - `R`: The address range type that the device uses. This determines the

///
/// # Implementation Notes
///
/// - All implementations must also implement [`Any`] to support runtime type checking.
/// - The `handle_read` and `handle_write` methods are called by the hypervisor's

///
/// # Arguments
///
/// - `device`: A reference to the device trait object.
/// - `f`: A function to call with a reference to the concrete device type.

/// # Returns
