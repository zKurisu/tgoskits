# Starry Test Suit

## Overview

StarryOS tests are data-driven. Cases live under `test-suit/starryos`, while discovery and execution are implemented mainly in:

- `scripts/axbuild/src/starry/test.rs`
- `scripts/axbuild/src/test/qemu.rs`
- `scripts/axbuild/src/test/case.rs`
- `scripts/axbuild/src/test/build.rs`

QEMU cases build the `starryos` package and run a per-arch `qemu-<arch>.toml`. Board cases build StarryOS for a board target and run a `board-<board>.toml` through the board runner.

## Workflow

1. Inspect the target directory under `test-suit/starryos` and the current Starry test flow in `scripts/axbuild/src/starry/test.rs`.
2. Decide whether the case is QEMU or board, and choose the root-level case or build wrapper under `test-suit/starryos`.
3. For QEMU, put the case directly under `test-suit/starryos/<case>` with its own matching `build-*.toml`, or choose a build wrapper directory that contains the matching `build-*.toml` files (`qemu-smp1`, `qemu-smp4`, or another wrapper), then add only the `qemu-<arch>.toml` files for architectures that actually pass. For `qemu-smp1` and `qemu-smp4`, the wrapper root only holds build configs and `system/` is the grouped QEMU case.
4. If the case needs guest assets, use exactly one pipeline: `c/`, `sh/`, `python/`, or grouped `test_commands` with subcase directories.
5. For board tests, add `board-<board>.toml` under the case directory and ensure the case or nearest build wrapper provides the needed `build-*.toml`.
6. Validate with the matching `cargo xtask starry test ...` command.
7. If discovery rules, CI expectations, or directory conventions change, update `test-suit/starryos/GUIDE.md` and relevant docs in the same change.

## Layout Rules

- Starry test-suit no longer uses `normal`, `stress`, or other first-level test groups. QEMU and board cases are discovered directly from `test-suit/starryos`.
- QEMU cases live at `test-suit/starryos/<case>/qemu-<arch>.toml` or `test-suit/starryos/<build_wrapper>/<case>/qemu-<arch>.toml`.
- Board cases live at `test-suit/starryos/<case>/board-<board>.toml` or `test-suit/starryos/<build_wrapper>/<case>/board-<board>.toml`.
- Build configs live in the case directory or nearest build wrapper as `build-<target>.toml`; `build-<arch>.toml` is also recognized when present.
- A build wrapper packages shared build configs and multiple cases. If a directory itself contains both `build-*` and `qemu-*` or `board-*`, it is also a case.
- QEMU discovery first selects directories with a build config matching the requested arch/target, then discovers matching `qemu-<arch>.toml` in that directory and below it.
- Board discovery scans for `board-*.toml` and resolves the build config from the case directory or nearest build wrapper.
- Batch QEMU runs skip case directories without the requested `qemu-<arch>.toml`; explicit `-c/--test-case` requires the case and config to exist under a matching build wrapper. Starry QEMU additionally accepts `-c qemu-smp1/<subcase>`, `-c qemu-smp4/<subcase>`, and `-c qemu-smp*/system/<subcase>` to run a single `qemu-smp*/system` grouped subcase.
- The old Starry `--test-group` and `--stress` entries have been removed. Heavy app, stress, K230, visual, and golden workloads live under `apps/starry` and use `cargo xtask starry app ...` or their own scripts.
- `-l/--list` lists all discovered Starry QEMU or board cases. Build-wrapper roots such as `qemu-smp1` are not listed unless the root itself has a runtime config.
- `qemu-smp1/system` and `qemu-smp4/system` are the aggregate QEMU cases for their wrappers. Their subcases keep assets only; do not add `qemu-<arch>.toml` under those subcase directories.

## QEMU Asset Pipelines

Each QEMU case may use at most one asset pipeline:

- `plain`: no extra asset directory and no `test_commands`; boots the shared rootfs with QEMU `-snapshot`.
- `c`: case directory has `c/CMakeLists.txt`; CMake builds and installs artifacts into a rootfs overlay.
- `sh`: case directory has `sh/`; scripts are copied into the guest overlay.
- `python`: case directory has `python/`; the runner installs `python3` in staging and copies `.py` files into `/usr/bin/`.
- `grouped`: `qemu-<arch>.toml` defines `test_commands`; subdirectories such as `<subcase>/c/` are built and a `/usr/bin/starry-run-case-tests` runner is injected. The `qemu-smp*/system` grouped cases use `system/CMakeLists.txt` as one root CMake project, keep each subcase's `CMakeLists.txt` and `src/` directly under `system/<subcase>`, scan `/usr/bin/starry-test-suit/*`, and use `STARRY_GROUPED_TESTS_PASSED` as the success marker. Single grouped subcases run through `-c qemu-smp*/<subcase>` or `-c qemu-smp*/system/<subcase>`.

Pipeline cases use per-case rootfs copies and cache injected images under `target/<target>/qemu-cases/.../cache/rootfs/`. Plain cases do not copy the rootfs.

## Case Content

Each `qemu-<arch>.toml` should define runtime behavior, not build config:

- `args`: arch-specific QEMU args
- `to_bin` / `uefi`
- `shell_prefix`
- `shell_init_cmd` for plain, C, shell, or Python cases
- `test_commands` for grouped cases; do not combine with `shell_init_cmd`
- `success_regex`
- `fail_regex`
- `timeout`

Prefer multi-line TOML strings for longer shell commands. Keep `fail_regex` narrow and choose stable, unique success markers.

## Failure Propagation

- These failure-propagation requirements are for Starry QEMU tests. Board tests continue to use the existing `board-<board>.toml` / board runner flow with `success_regex`, `fail_regex`, and optional `shell_init_cmd`; do not force board cases into the QEMU grouped/C runner structure.
- Starry QEMU tests must make real failures visible to the runner. Do not print a failure message while still letting `cargo xtask starry test qemu ...` exit successfully.
- QEMU `success_regex` and `fail_regex` must reliably distinguish the intended pass and fail states. A failure marker such as `STARRY_GROUPED_TEST_FAILED` must be matched by `fail_regex`, and the all-passed marker must only appear after every required subcase has passed.
- In QEMU grouped/system wrappers, any failing subcase must print the per-subcase failure marker, suppress the grouped all-passed marker, print a grouped failure marker, and return a nonzero result to the outer runner.
- In QEMU shell wrappers, capture a test command's `$?` immediately after the command before assigning variables, printing logs, or doing cleanup. Assignments such as `status=failed` reset `$?` to zero and can hide the true exit status if done first.
- Explicit QEMU skips are allowed only when the test prints a clear skip marker and the review or case comment explains why the environment cannot require success. Bugfix and regression QEMU tests should fail loudly when the fixed behavior is absent.

## Editing Rules

- Reuse the closest existing case as a template.
- Keep arch-specific boot args intact unless the platform requirement really changes.
- Add architecture configs only after validating that architecture.
- Do not define more than one pipeline in the same case directory.
- For C cases, install outputs through CMake `install()` so they land in the guest overlay.
- Use `prebuild.sh` only for packages or setup that must happen inside the staging rootfs.
- For grouped cases, keep `test_commands` aligned with installed guest paths and include the grouped success/fail regexes.
- For `qemu-smp*/system` C subcases, install binaries to `usr/bin/starry-test-suit`. Put shared system rootfs preparation in `system/prebuild.sh`, not in subcase-local `prebuild.sh`. If a subcase is arch-specific, generate an explicit skip binary or skip in the program; do not rely on subcase-local `qemu-<arch>.toml` filtering.
- Board case names and board config names should match the actual board target, such as `board-orangepi-5-plus.toml`.

## Validation

Use xtask commands:

```bash
cargo xtask starry test qemu --arch riscv64
cargo xtask starry test qemu --arch aarch64 -c qemu-smp1/system
cargo xtask starry test qemu --arch x86_64 -c qemu-smp1/syscall-test-uid-gid-re-setters
cargo xtask starry app qemu -t stress/git --arch riscv64
cargo xtask starry test board --board orangepi-5-plus
```

When changing Rust logic under `scripts/axbuild`, also run targeted formatting and clippy according to the repository rules:

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo xtask clippy --package axbuild
```

## Common Pitfalls

- Do not run multiple `cargo xtask starry test qemu` commands in parallel in one workspace checkout.
- `test-suit/starryos` is not a Cargo crate. Do not add `Cargo.toml` or `src/` there.
- Do not rely on build group names to distinguish QEMU from board; QEMU is discovered by `qemu-<arch>.toml`, board by `board-<board>.toml`.
- `shell_init_cmd` and `test_commands` are mutually exclusive.
- Heavy app, stress, K230, visual, and golden workloads should stay in `apps/starry`, not under `test-suit/starryos`.
- If a case needs SMP, use an appropriate build group/config such as `qemu-smp4` instead of only adding QEMU `-smp`.
